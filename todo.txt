Modify Sideka() class method to :
- better capturing "desa" URLs

Table content is dynamically loaded by JS, 
inspected elements only show what is currently displayed on our browser
- is there a way to capture ALL elements of a dynamically loaded web?

Create a Desa() class to which has the following class methods :
- visit each Desa's URLs
- visit the top 3 news articles
- get the web content, and do NLP on each
